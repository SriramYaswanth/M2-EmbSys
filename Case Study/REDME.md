##   Components:

Smoke sensor:  it used to detect fires by sensing small particles in the air.

Temperature sensor : it is a device used to measure temperature.

Analog to digital convertor : used to convert an analog signal such as voltage to a digital form so that it can be read and processed by a microcontroller.

Microcontroller : 8051 Microcontroller.

LCD Display :  For display purpose.

GSM modem : used to communicate over the mobile sending sms.

Buzzer : An audio signaling device.

Voltage Regulator: A voltage regulator is a system designed to automatically maintain a constant voltage.
