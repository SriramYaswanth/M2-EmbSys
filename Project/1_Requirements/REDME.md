# Vehicle Seat Heat Generatot & Monitoring System
****
# Abstract
- As now-a-days we are looking for the automation and advancement in all the sectors, In cars also we are getting new features as of growing technology in that verichle seat heat Monetring system is one as per our comforts.
-  In the Vehicle Seat Heat Monitoring System It is capable of maintaining of heat in the vehicles seats. In European countries, the temperature is very low and any electronic designer should make sure that his equipment should work efficiently in weather conditions in collest places. 
- In our project, the Temperature sensor will sense is the driver has been seated or not and if the driver seated then he need to set the temperature accordingly. Based on that our controller will set the heater to required temperature. The Heater will generate the heat and a LCD display will show requested the temperature as we required.
- In our project we have used ATmega328 microcontroller along with temperature sensor, Push button, Heat generator, LED and LCD diplay,etc.


# Requirements
1. ATMEGA 328 
- It iscommonly used in many projects and autonomous systems where a simple, low-powered, low-cost micro-controller is needed
2. Temperature Sensors.
- It is a device used to measure temperature.
3. Heat generator
4. Thermostat. 
- used for electric current to a heating or cooling.
5. LCD 
- Liquid Crystal Display used to display Temperature- Generated heat.
6. LED 
- Light Emitting Diode used as indicator.


# SWOT ANALYSIS
## Strengths
1. It has Designed User Friendly
2. It is easy to change the temperature inside the vehicles.
3. Low cost and Robust system.
## Weakness
1. Its only used for the countries those  which are having low temperature/ collest places.
2. Low sensitivity.
## Opportunities
1. It can be implemented by having both Heater and AC.
2.  It require short time and less expense to implement and it will consume less energy.
## Threats
1. It is not suitable for average or high temperature places ,it used only in coll temperature places.
2. High electric resistance can make it to get over heated.

# 4W's and 1'H
### WHAT 
Vehicle Seat Heat Monitoring System, these heated seats can make us more comfortable in the winter or low temperature areas/places.
### WHEN
It can be used at low Temperature areas/places(coolest places),It is used in Vehicled, Mainly used in Cars
### WHERE 
Used in the Vehicle seats and Automobile indistries.
### WHY
Vehicle Seat Heat Monitoring System these Heating system in our vehicle is designed to keep us warm, mainly in very cool Temperatures and we can feel more comfortable.
### HOW
It can be modfied by changing the temperature we can feel comfort at any temperatur or coolest climatic conditions.
