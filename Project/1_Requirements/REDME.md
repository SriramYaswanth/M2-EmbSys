# Vehicle Seat Heat Monitoring System
****
# Abstract
- As now-a-days we are looking for the automation and advancement in all the sectors, In cars also we are getting new features as of growing technology in that verichle seat heat Monetring system is one as per our comforts.
-  In the Vehicle Seat Heat Monitoring System It is capable of maintaining of heat in the vehicles seats. In European countries, the temperature is very low and any electronic designer should make sure that his equipment should work efficiently in weather conditions in collest places. 
- In our project, the Temperature sensor will sense is the driver has been seated or not and if the driver seated then he need to set the temperature accordingly. Based on that our controller will set the heater to required temperature. The Heater will generate the heat and a LCD display will show requested the temperature as we required.
- In our project we have used ATmega328 microcontroller along with temperature sensor, Push button, Heat generator, LED and LCD diplay,etc.


# SWOT ANALYSIS
## Strengths
- Designed User Friendly
- Easy to change the temperature inside the vehicles.
- Low cost and Robust system.

## Weakness
- Its only applicable for those countries which are having low temperature.
## Opportunities
- It can be implemented by having both Heater and AC.
## Threats
- Not suitable for average or high temperature places.
